## 🎨 Syntax Philosophy

- **Red (Gryffindor):** Bold `class` declarations → courage made manifest  
- **Green (Slytherin):** Cunning `if` statements → ambition in logic  
- **Blue (Ravenclaw):** Wise `import` and keywords → knowledge as foundation  
- **Yellow (Hufflepuff):** Loyal strings & numbers → steadfast values  
- **Grayish tones (Professors):** Comments → the voices of your mentors  
- **Error highlights:** *Avada Kedavra!* (because bugs can feel like curses)
